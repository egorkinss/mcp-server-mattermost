## Quick Reference

The **Capability** column shows each tool's access level (`read`, `write`, `create`, `delete`).
This is metadata for client-side filtering — it does not affect runtime behavior.
See [Building Agents](../building-agents.md) for how to use capabilities
to filter tools by agent profile.

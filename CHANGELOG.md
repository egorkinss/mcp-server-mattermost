## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `get_channel_messages` now supports two new mutually-exclusive modes:
  - `unread_only=True` — fetches the user's unread window via Mattermost's
    `/users/me/channels/{id}/posts/unread` endpoint, with `limit_before` /
    `limit_after` bounds and a `collapsed_threads` flag for CRT-on users.
  - `since=<unix_ms>` — fetches posts modified after a timestamp via `?since=`,
    suitable for incremental sync.
- `PostList` now exposes `truncated: bool` — `True` when the response hit Mattermost's
  response cap (`1000` for `?since=`, `limit_before + limit_after` for `/posts/unread`,
  `per_page` for default pagination).
- `docs/examples.md` — restored "Morning Catch-Up" example, now end-to-end with the new
  unread-window flow, and added a "Bot Monitor Loop" recipe with two patterns
  (simple `unread_only` + `mark_channel_viewed`, and at-least-once `since` + watermark).
- `list_my_channels` accepts an `only_unread` filter to return only channels
  with unread messages.
- `mark_channel_viewed(channel_id)` — new tool that marks a channel as viewed
  for the authenticated user. Resets the channel-member unread counters and
  advances `last_viewed_at`. Documented usage: explicit user intent or a
  bot-monitoring loop that owns the read state.
- New `MATTERMOST_AUTH_MODE` setting selects one of three authentication strategies per server process: `static_token` (default), `client_token`, or `oauth_proxy`.
- `oauth_proxy` mode using FastMCP `OAuthProxy` with Mattermost OAuth 2.0 Applications. Supports both confidential and public client modes; PKCE forwarded upstream in both cases.
- New OAuth-related settings: `MATTERMOST_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `MATTERMOST_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `MATTERMOST_OAUTH_CLIENT_TYPE`, `MATTERMOST_OAUTH_MCP_PUBLIC_URL`, `MATTERMOST_OAUTH_MATTERMOST_PUBLIC_URL`, `MATTERMOST_OAUTH_CALLBACK_PATH`, `MATTERMOST_OAUTH_JWT_SIGNING_KEY`, `MATTERMOST_OAUTH_REQUIRE_CONSENT`, `MATTERMOST_OAUTH_ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URIS`, `MATTERMOST_OAUTH_FALLBACK_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY_SECONDS`.
- New `docs/authentication.md` page covering all three auth modes, Mattermost OAuth App registration, MCP client connection, troubleshooting, and the full env-var reference.

### Changed
- `list_my_channels` now returns four unread counters for each channel:
  `unread_msg_count` / `mention_count` use non-root semantics — replies in
  threads are counted, matching the channel badge when Collapsed Reply Threads
  is off; `unread_msg_count_root` / `mention_count_root` count only root posts,
  matching the badge when Collapsed Reply Threads is on.
- `get_channel_messages`: tightened `limit_after` validation to `1-200`
  (Mattermost rejects `limit_after=0` with HTTP 400; the previous `ge=0` bound
  surfaced an unclear server error).
- Rewrote `get_channel_messages` and `mark_channel_viewed` docstrings to be
  self-contained and compact: intent → mode mapping up front, footgun-only
  notes (`last_viewed_at == 0` bootstrap quirk, `since`-mode tombstones,
  `truncated` semantics), implementation detail moved to Field descriptions
  to keep agent context budget small.
- The Docker image now installs the package at build time. Container startup invokes the venv binary directly instead of going through `uv run`, eliminating a redundant `uv sync` on every start.
- **Behavioral change:** in `client_token` mode (and the new `oauth_proxy` mode), requests without a validated bearer token now fail with `AuthenticationError` instead of silently falling back to `MATTERMOST_TOKEN`. If you previously relied on the bot-token fallback for unauthenticated requests, switch to `MATTERMOST_AUTH_MODE=static_token` and remove `MATTERMOST_ALLOW_HTTP_CLIENT_TOKENS`.
- **Behavioral change:** setting both `MATTERMOST_ALLOW_HTTP_CLIENT_TOKENS=true` and `MATTERMOST_AUTH_MODE` to a non-`client_token` value now raises a configuration error at startup. Previously the legacy flag was silently ignored when both were set with conflicting values.
- **Behavioral change:** `mcp_server_mattermost.server` module import now performs full configuration validation eagerly. Tools or test fixtures that imported the module before configuring environment variables may need to be updated.

### Deprecated
- `MATTERMOST_ALLOW_HTTP_CLIENT_TOKENS=true` is now an alias for `MATTERMOST_AUTH_MODE=client_token`. Prefer setting `MATTERMOST_AUTH_MODE` explicitly.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-24

### Breaking Changes
- Renamed `list_channels` tool to `list_public_channels` — same behavior, clearer name

### Added
- New `list_my_channels` tool: returns channels the authenticated user belongs to
  (public, private, DM, group) with optional `channel_types` filter
- Per-client token authentication: `MATTERMOST_ALLOW_HTTP_CLIENT_TOKENS` env var enables
  HTTP clients to pass their own Mattermost token via `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
  The token is validated against the Mattermost API (`GET /api/v4/users/me`) on each
  connection. When disabled (default), the server uses `MATTERMOST_TOKEN` from environment.
- `MattermostTokenVerifier` class (`auth.py`): custom FastMCP 3 `TokenVerifier` that
  validates Mattermost bearer tokens and injects them into the request context.

### Fixed
- Suppress `KeyboardInterrupt` traceback on server shutdown
- Added `wsproto` to dependencies (required for WebSocket transport)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-25

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Migrated from FastMCP 2 to FastMCP 3
  - Tool registration: `@mcp.tool()` → `@tool()` from `fastmcp.tools`
  - Auto-discovery via `FileSystemProvider` replaces manual tool imports
  - Lifespan uses `@lifespan` decorator from `fastmcp.server.lifespan`
  - DI providers moved from `server.py` to new `deps.py` module
  - Removed `# type: ignore[arg-type]` — FastMCP 3 has proper DI typing

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- Tool capability metadata (`read`, `write`, `create`, `delete`) for agent-based tool filtering

### Fixed

- Lifespan context manager now uses try/finally for reliable resource cleanup
- Added retry logic to `upload_file` method
- Parse HTTP-date format in Retry-After header (previously caused ValueError)

### Changed

- Migrated documentation hosting to Read the Docs
- Added best practices guide, usage examples with screenshots, and scenario prompts
- New project icon replacing ASCII-art logo
